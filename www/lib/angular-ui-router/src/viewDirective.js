 * @description
 * The ui-view directive tells $state where to place your templates.
 *
 * @param {string=} name A view name. The name should be unique amongst the other views in the
 * same state. You can have views of the same name that live in different states.
 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll It allows you to set the scroll behavior of the browser window
 * when a view is populated. By default, $anchorScroll is overridden by ui-router's custom scroll
 * service, {@link ui.router.state.$uiViewScroll}. This custom service let's you
 * scroll ui-view elements into view when they are populated during a state activation.
 *
 * *Note: To revert back to old [`$anchorScroll`](http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$anchorScroll)
 * functionality, call `$uiViewScroll
